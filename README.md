### Why Hello there ðŸ‘‹

:smile:	I'm a Newcastle University graduate, with good problem solving skills and good attention to detail. My previous experiences while working across Europe and while at university has given me a natural ability to quickly learn new skills and to take a cooperative approach to reach targets and goals. The COVID-19 lockdown has given me chance to develop my passion for technology and software.

:star: My goals are to contribute to open source software and to kickstart my career in software engineering!

:seedling: I'm teaching myself the language C++ and the theory of a transistor.
